Problem: Since the outbreak of Covid, goverments have put restriction on the  number of people in 
places so we have a come up with an App that counts the number of people present in a place to ensure 
the rules are followed and prevent overcrowding to reduce the spread of covid, As it wouldnt be 
possible for a human to count each time.
Solution: through Machine Learning algorithms and AI to identify and inform authorities and managers 
about the population in a given area.

Why is AI a better solution?
In the long term, AI will be much more cost-effective due to it's requirement of only a camera and an
algorithm running in the backend, that constantly learns from data it's provided with. The use of AI
may also be more accurate than paying an employee to count, as large crowds may lead to human error
in counting or may produce bias results if performed by someone working at the company.

Data description: The data is provided in a video format (mp4, avi) and has to show crowds moving from 
one end of an area to another. The camera must be placed at a birds eye view.

Data set: It will make use of a compilation of videos of people moving up and down and count how many
people move in a downward direction and how many people move up, which will be outputted.

Methodology: A machine learning algorithm will be implemented to learn from several videos to be able
to differentiate people from other objects and to count individual people within a group and identify
whether they are moving upwards (i.e entering) or moving downwards (i.e leaving).
