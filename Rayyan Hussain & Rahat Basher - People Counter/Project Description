Problem: Since the outbreak of Covid, goverments have put restriction on the  number of people in 
places so we have a come up with an App that counts the number of people present in a place to ensure 
the rules are followed and prevent overcrowding to reduce the spread of covid, As it wouldnt be 
possible for a human to count each time.
Solution: through Machine Learning algorithms and AI to identify and inform authorities and managers 
about the population in a given area.
