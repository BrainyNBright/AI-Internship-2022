Our project was creating a "People Counter" AI system to be used, now more than ever due to the pandemic, and throughout our development of the program we learnt about different methods of machine learning such as CNN (which was what we ended up incorporating). Our idea could be implemented world wide to reduce spread of disease, therefore highly profitable due to its demand from large companies and/or governments.
