Data description

The dataset contains data about the racetrack and certain obstacles in the way of it, and we used the
Object Detection method to identify specific objects in the car's view.

We have 3 labels:

Borders

We took approximately 1000 images of the track and are using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing the model.
