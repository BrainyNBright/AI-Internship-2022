Data description

The dataset contains data about the racetrack and certain obstacles in the way of it, and we used the
Object Detection method to identify specific objects in the car's view.

What is Object detection?

Object detection is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video.
Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects, which allow us to locate where said objects are in a given scene.

We have 3 labels:

Borders
Drivable Land
Obstacle

We took approximately 1000 images as our data and are using 80% of it for training the model and 20% for testing the model.
