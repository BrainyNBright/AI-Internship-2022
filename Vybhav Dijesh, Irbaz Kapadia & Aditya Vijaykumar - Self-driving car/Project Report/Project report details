Project Report:
 After training the model for 25 epochs, it was tested on the udacity driving simulator with a completely different track
 (See other project report file for evidence)
 
 The simulation ran with loss: 1.1619 - accuracy: 0.5595 - val_loss: 0.1377 - val_accuracy: 0.8309,
 this was a major improvement to the previous values which had a much lower accuracy and nearly double the loss rate
 
 We have used three dense layers with 100, 50 and 10 neurons respectively and elu as the activation function
 Also in between, We have used 50% dropouts to reduce over-fitting the values 
 (See other project report file for accuracy and loss graph)
