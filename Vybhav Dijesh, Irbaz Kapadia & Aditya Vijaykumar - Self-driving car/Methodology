Methodology

We have found references needed to create the model,
so we are few steps closer to building it.

We first need an algorithm that will act as the foundation from which the program can be coded.
The algorithm we will be using is Neural Network algorithm.

There are different types of Neural Network Classifications, for example:

Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Convolution Neural Networks:

An image data processing deep learning algorithm called a convolutional neural network (CNN) was created for this purpose.
In order to recognize and process images, complicated neural networks are used.
The frontal lobe of the human brain, which is the area of the brain in charge of processing visual stimuli, 
is represented by the neural networks in a CNN.
The advantages of convolutional neural networks include:

They can detect important features without human supervision 
It has the highest accuracy amongst image detection algorithms
It is easy to understand and implement.
