Self-Driving Cars

1) About the problem:

What is the problem?
Every year, traffic accidents account for 2.2% of global deaths. That stacks up to roughly 1.3 million a year — 3,287 a day. On top of this, some 20–50 million people are seriously injured in auto-related accidents each year.

2) The solution:

What are self-driving cars ?
A self-driving automobile is a vehicle that navigates between destinations without a driver by utilizing sensors, cameras, radar, 
and artificial intelligence (AI). A vehicle must be capable of navigating to a predefined location across roads that have notbeen 
modified for its usage in order to be considered completely autonomous.

How can we implment this ?
Self driving cars are majorily implemented through the use of many sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems,
and powerful processors to execute software.Autonomous cars create and maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors situated
in different parts of the vehicle.
