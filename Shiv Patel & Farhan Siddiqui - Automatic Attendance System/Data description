We utilized three folders in our project: train, test, and validation. 
The major folder for assisting the artificial intelligence in understanding the photographs, Train, 
has 570 images of the pupils, 10 of which are from the left, right, and front.
Last but not least, we have validation, which is used for assessment and has 3 photos per student for the evaluation,
all of which are distinct from the test's 8 images, one from each student, used to determine if the ai is functioning 
or not.
