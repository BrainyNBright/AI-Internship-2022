What is the problem?

In many places such as schools, offices etc, attendance is marked manually. One person has to manually check whether people are 
absent of present and then manually mark them as such. This process is time consuming.

The Solution:

The solution to this is to create an automated Attendance system that can use facial recognition to automatically indentify
the person and mark that person as present. There will be a camera that takes a picture of the student/employee etc at the
beginning of the day and then facial recognition will be used to identify who the person is. Once they are recognized, they are
marked present

Why do we need AI?
Artificial Intelligence will be needed to recognize faces and identify who they are and them mark them as present. The AI's dataset
will be the images of a certain group of people and their names, and the AI will have to be trained so that it can recognize a 
person from the dataset when he is present in another photo.
