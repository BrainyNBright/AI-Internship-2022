We'll be working on Google Colab as our platform.

The libraries dlib, numpy, pandas, pathlib, mathplotlib, glob, OpenCV will be used.

Firstly, we will photograph each student in the classroom and post those images to Google Colab. Number of images of each 
student will be 30 images, 10 from the front, 10 from the left side and 10 from the right side. 

Thereafter, we'll train the AI to identify the pictures.

The AI will be then tested with a different photo of a person who's photo was already used to train the AI to see if
the AI can identify correctly the identity of that person. This evaluating image will be obtained through a image 
captured by a webcam on site. This image will be imported to the program by using python3 webcam - capture - v1.01.py.
This command will also automatically conver the image to grayscale and 28x28 size.

If the answer is no, a relevant message will be displayed
if the answer is yes, That person will be marked as Present in a 2D array in the code. Each element of the array wil
that day.

if the answer is yes, That person will be marked as Present in a 2D array in the code. Each element of the array will 
have the names of student, and whether they are present or absent. Prior to the running of the code, all students
would be marked as absent, and will be changed to present when the AI has identified a student after a webcam takes a 
photo of them.

After the end of the designated time for registering attendance through the webcam, the array will be transferred to
an excel sheet using .toexcel(excel_writer = ".....")

This excel sheet will tell us the attendance of every student for that day.
