1. Import the libraries and modules required, including: pandas, numpy and matplotlib
2. Read the dataset using pandas, and then assign the data to a variable
3. Explore the data using data info, getting overall understanding of the data we are working with. The Rows, columns, mean, median, range etc are taken into consideration,
4. Data Pre-processing is done
5. We have to standardize the data into 0's and 1's so they are all within the same range to be plotted
6. Train Test split
7. Find the dependent and independent variables for data analysis
8. Now we have to plot our data into a graph using matplotlib to see any correlation or variance.
9. Plot a line of best fit
10. Find it's slope and intercept
11. XGBoost Regressor
12. Evaluation
