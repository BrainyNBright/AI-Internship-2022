Problem Statement: The chaotic uncertainties and hassles caused by the ever-volatile real estate market faze millions across the globe. Most people lack adequate knowledge and insight in getting the best prices for their estates, thus propelling financial mismanagement and misuse.
Hence, to tackle this looming problem, our group has designed a model using Artificial intelligence and Machine learning to envisage the most equitable prices for our clients.

This model would be capable of learning from the given datasets, to predict your median house price using a plethora of metrics.

Pitch:
Who will it benefit, and how?
Home sellers & buyers, real estate developers, agents, brokers, and insurance lenders.
This would be beneficial to them to know the trend of housing prices according to their characteristics and location.

How does our model benefit this use case?
Our model employs a regression algorithm that considers property features like size, age, number of rooms, and location to arrive at a viable price range.
