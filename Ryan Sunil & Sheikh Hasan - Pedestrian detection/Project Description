Pedestrian Detection

1) About the problem:
 
	What is the problem?

		A self driving car has no way to distinguish between a pedestrian and other obstacles so a pedestrian detection algorithim is required for all self driving cars.

	What causes the problem?

		Robots need a way to translate pixels in an image into things like: Pedestrian, Traffic light, Road sign... etc. and pedestrian detection algorithim can do just that

2) The Solution:

	What is Pedestrian Detection?

		Pedestrian Detection is an artificial intelligence system than can be used to distinguish between pedestrians.

	How can we implement Pedestrian Detection?

		A Pedestrian detection algorithim can be used in self driving cars to distinguish pedestrians on the road and ensure their safety.

3) How does AI help in making this possible:
