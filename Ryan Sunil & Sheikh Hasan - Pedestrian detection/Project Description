Pedestrian Detection

1) About the problem:
 
	What is the problem?

		Humans are not optimal because if they are not focused enough they might not notice the 
		pedestrians on the road and this could be a serious hazard and it already has costed many 
		people simple because they did not notice but a computer does not have to worry about how 
		focused it is because no matter what it will always have a 100% focus and will have eyes 
		everywhere even where humans cant see.
		
		A self driving car has no way to distinguish between a pedestrian and other obstacles 
		so a pedestrian detection algorithim is required for all self driving cars.

	What causes the problem?

		Many things can cause people to not see a pedestrian for example: They could get distracted 
		or they could not be paying attention or many other similar reasons but they can all be avoided 
		by using machines as they do not get tired or distracted like humans do.
		
		Robots need a way to translate pixels in an image into things like: Pedestrian, Traffic light, 
		Road sign... etc. and pedestrian detection algorithim can do just that.

2) The Solution:

	What is Pedestrian Detection?

		Pedestrian Detection is an artificial intelligence system than can be used to 
		distinguish between pedestrians.

	How can we implement Pedestrian Detection?

		A Pedestrian detection algorithim can be used in self driving cars to distinguish 
		pedestrians on the road and ensure their safety.

3) How does AI help in making this possible:

	AI can be used to identify pedestrians on the road and this data can be further used in hand 
	with self driving car technology in order to ensure the safety of all pedestrians on the road
