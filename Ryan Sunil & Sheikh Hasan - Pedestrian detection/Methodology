Methodology

We have found some references and datasets that we can use so the next step is to refer to them to start with the code

to make a pedestrian detection algorithim we need to use neural networks for the machine learning. there are 3 types of neural networks:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

we are going to be using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) because this is the best neural network for our purpose

to start with our code we first need to import some modules that are required like:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
These are some of the modules that we will need for our code
