Methodology

We have found some references and datasets that we can use so the next step is to refer to them to start with the code

to make a pedestrian detection algorithim we need to use neural networks for the machine learning. there are 3 types of neural networks:

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

we are going to be using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) because this is the best neural network for our purpose

ANN turns an image into an 1 dimensional array and then uses activation functions but this means we will lose spatial data because the input will be only 1 dimentional when the image is 2 dimentional

RNN loops through past inputs and tries to find a connection but this is mostly used only for sequential data that is affected by the previous input like text and time ect and will not be suitable for images and our goal

CNN uses maths to find edges and identify shapes this is very useful in computer vision to find and identify specific objects in an image and this is why we have also decided to use the CNN algorithim



to start with our code we first need to import some modules that are required like:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
These are some of the modules that we will need for our code
