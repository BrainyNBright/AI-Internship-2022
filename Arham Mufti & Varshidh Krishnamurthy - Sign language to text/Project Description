What is the problem?
The problem is not everyone knows sign language and would not be able to understand someone speaking in sign language.

How can this problem be solved?
By creating a code that can read and give out what sign language is to text.

How does AI make this possible?
AI makes this possible because through the use of image classification and a neural network, we can create a code that can convert sign language to text. This uses deep learning
processes in order to train the machine learning model to identify each gesture in sign language and translate it to text so that a person who is unable to understand sign language can
understand the conversation by text.
