Methodology:

So far we have collected the relevant data needed to train and test the model, so now we need to create the model. 

To build a product propensity model, we first need an algorithm that will act as the foundation from which the program can be coded. 


There are many algorithms that we can choose from:

1. Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
