There are massive flaws in the algorithms as to how the market moves and it only takes in the past price movements.
While displaying outcomes according to previous events in the past years on the state of the economy and how it was in the past,
not considering the current situation of the world that affects how the price flow of the market could either crash or rise.

All tho it might not be good to rely on the AI algorithm completely there are cases where the AI can predict the stock with some error.
While the algorithms have a lot of data in use they can be very accurate but come at a huge risk while you may have a huge return there could be a huge loss.
Its widely used by people for stock trading and investment because it can predict future patterns more accurately than before.

The reason I picked stock price prediction because it helps make more accurate investment decisions in the stock markets, as it is the smart way yo make money
and since you are being informed and given the necessary information to make your decisions it involves less risk to your outcomes as raising your wealth,
which minimizes your loss and some times saves them before the market could crash.
The main idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits and since there are other external factors that affect the price of a stock,
like the state of other economies or decisions made by leaders changing the prices making it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.
