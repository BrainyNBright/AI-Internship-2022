What is the problem?

There are many minerals found in the world which cannot be identified on the spot. This is because many minerals are similar in looks and also have similar properties. It is only through further analysis is can be identified correctly. This further analysis utilises lots of time and resources which can be used elsewhere, such as mapping and understanding how the local geographical landscape is composed.

How can this problem be solved?

Artificial Intelligence can be used to simplify and reduce the amount of time spent on this problem. Using a pre-existing database, the algorithm will be able to predict the correct mineral, using less data than what was previously required.
