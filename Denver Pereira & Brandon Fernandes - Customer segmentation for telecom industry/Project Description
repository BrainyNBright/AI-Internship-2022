What is the problem?
Products are not tailored and advertised in a way attractive to different types of demographic, this causes a reduction in sales due to the lack of attention by the 
customer.
The cause.
It is caused due to the lack of market segmentation and resources to segment the market, often it is expensive to conduct primary research this is as, 
for example, data packages advertised are too general instead of specific rendering the advertising useless. There has to be a more targetted advertising
and marketing to different segments of people who use telecommunication, for example, younger people will see more advertisements for Etisalat and Du on social media 
while older people more on billboards and calls to upgrade their current package
The Solution
Customer segmentation.
To have a more specific way of advertising and marketing the customers need to be separated based on similar characteristics, this is so advertising can be more targeted 
to a certain demographic to be more appealing, for higher sales
How will we do this?
Separating the database into clusters using unsupervised learning
Why do we need A.I?
In our project, artificial intelligence is employed to precisely and effectively categorize customers into several groups.
