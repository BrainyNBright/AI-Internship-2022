This dataset contains these columns:

-Satisfactory Levels
-Last Evaluation
-Number Project
-Average Monthly Hour
-Time Spent
-Promotion last 5 years
-Work accidents
-Left
-Salary
-Department

the first column called "Satisfaction Levels" will provide how satisfied the employee is with their job in a scale from 0 (being completely unsatisfied) 
to 1 (being completely satisfied). the following column "Last Evaluation" is the employees previously recorded satisfactory levels. 

the 3rd to 5th column includes analytics of the employee in their job which shows the number of projects they have taken, their average monthly hour, and the
time spent in the company (in years)

The sixth column called "Work_accident" will show us how many accidents a person has done while working and can be used to determine how organized and 
focused an employee is, its values are either 0 (having no work accidents) or 1 (having 1 or more work accidents)

The seventh column called "Left" can be used to determine the employees behavioral nature by checking the history being fired or quitting on short notice, 
this will also be determined with values 0 (has not left) and 1 (has left). This will allow our model to develop and predict more accurately based on previous 
unsatisfied employees.
