1. What is the problem?

    Educational institutes (schools, colleges, universities) often have an official website where parents and students would oftentimes visit with queries and/or
    complaints. Oftentimes the website may prove too difficult to navigate and/or confusing, otherwise the website would redirect the parents/students to a phone
    call with the school's receptionists. However, in the latter case, it adds more duties to the hands of the receptionists and makes it more difficult to answer
    numerous calls. Another problem is that parents and students may not want to call for various reasons. It may also be very inconvenient for studdents and
    parents to be put on hold when they call.
    
2. What is the solution?

    A probable solution could be the implementation of chatbots, especially in cases where the educational institution's administration is not available for
    students and parents 24/7. Utilizing a chatbot, in this scenario, would mean that students and parents will no longer have to wait on hold for human assistance.
    A chatbot can provide all relevant information on being asked a single question. Not only does it effectively eliminate the need for phone calls and any
    potential issue it may pose for students/parents (eg. not wanting to talk due to sore throat), it also decreases the responsibilities of receptionists.
