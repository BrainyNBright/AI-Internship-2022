Why is Gender important?
Gender is important because it depends on the viewer or the movie, for example, boys might prefer marvel movies more than girls as it involves
things that come to their liking, this can affect the data because there might be more guys who prefer the movie over girls. 

Why is the date important? 
The date is important as it gives an idea of when the person has watched the movie either at the time of the release 
or a few months or years down the line. It would show the interest of the person and how engrossed he or she is in the movie.
