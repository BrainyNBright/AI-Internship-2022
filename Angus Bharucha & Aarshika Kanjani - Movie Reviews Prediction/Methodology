Methodology

So far we have collected the relevant data needed to train and test the model,
Now we need to create the model. 

To build a movie review model, we first need an algorithm that will act as the foundation from which the program can be coded.

There are many algorithms that we can choose from:

1) Make a DataFrame from Random Numbers
2) Count Group Elements
3) Linear Search
4) Decision Trees
5) 

The graphs that we are going to be using:

1) Pie Chart
2) Line Graph
3) Bar Graph
4) Scatter Graph
