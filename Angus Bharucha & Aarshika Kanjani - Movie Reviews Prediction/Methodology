Methodology

So far we have collected the relevant data needed to train and test the model,
Now we need to create the model. 

To build a movie review model, we first need an algorithm that will act as the foundation from which the program can be coded.

These are the algorithms that we implemented in this machine learning project:

1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Trees

The graphs that we are going to be using:

1) Pie Chart
2) Line Graph
3) Bar Graph
4) Scatter Graph

Libraries:

1) Pandas — For handling structured data
2) Scikit Learn — For machine learning
3) NumPy — For linear algebra and mathematics

Model Selection:

As mentioned at the start of the article the task is supervised machine learning. 
We know it’s a regression task because we are being asked to predict a numerical outcome.

I used the decision tree as my baseline model then built on this experience to tune my candidate models. 
This approach saves a lot of time as decision trees are quick to train and can give you an idea of how to tune the hyperparameters for my candidate models.





Training:

Now we can begin with the actual method as to how we are going to train the model.

We have our data collected and organized, we first need to separate the data into 
train and test.
We do this using the train_test_split function, which will split all the data values into variables such as:
  - x_train
  - x_test
  - y_train
  - y_test
  
The parameters used in the function will be the predictor variable and target (predicted feature) variable.

Now we import .naive_bayes (our classifier algorithm) from sklearn to train the model 
Use the .fit function - x_train, y_train as parameters

  
Training accuracy:

We can find how accurate our model is after training, using .accuracy_score from sklearn.
