Idea: The movie end game was one of marvel's most famous movies. 
It was most famous as it was the ending of the avengers faze. However, this movie is not liked by everyone, some people like it and others don’t, 
so let's analyze the movie reviews to find out what people feel about it.  
The idea behind this project is to give people recommendations based on the movies they watch and reviews of the people
who have watched that particular movie.

Problem statement: Criticizers and supporters of the marvel fan base input their reviews about the movie.
The problem we are trying to solve is to see or view the percentage of people who liked or didn’t like the film and test 
the machine to see how accurate it is.
