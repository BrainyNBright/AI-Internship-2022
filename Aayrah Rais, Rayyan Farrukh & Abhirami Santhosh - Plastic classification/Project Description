Here is our project description:
People should use this project if they are uncertain about what is a plastic and a bioplastic as the computer can tell them apart. 
It will help people recognize and use Bioplastic more and plastic less. 
The often-cited advantages of bioplastics are reduced use of fossil fuel resources, less pollution, less global warming, and a more eco-friendly world.
The computer will identify the two different types of plastic and categorize them as “plastic” or “bioplastics”. 
With AI the computer is able to understand the different algorithms, codes, variables and will be able to solve the problem state. 
Since it is comparing the differences between plastic and Bioplastic with the help of AI the computer can tell us the differences between those 2 as we know plastic is 
more dangerous while on the other hand Bioplastic is biodegradable.
