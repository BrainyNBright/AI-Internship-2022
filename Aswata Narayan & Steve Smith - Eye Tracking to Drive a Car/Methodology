1.We first gathered the eyes of different people for the machine learning model
2.We created a dataset out of these eyes and split it into a train,test and valid split
3.We used the dataset to create a model using tensorflow which can detect the gaze of peoples' eyes
4.Then we created a eye tracker using dlib libary
5.We then created a protype of the car to be controlled using Lego Spike Prime
6.We then connected the Spike Prime and Raspberry pi via bluetooth
7.We then wrote a program to make the car move depending on wether gaze of the eyes which were detected
8.Finally we combined the model, the eye tracker and the movement program to make the Spike Prime Car move using eye movements
