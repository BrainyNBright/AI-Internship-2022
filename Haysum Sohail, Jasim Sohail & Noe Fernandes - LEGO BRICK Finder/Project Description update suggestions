LEGO BRICK Finder

The aim of the LEGO BRICK Finder is to recognize a set of lego pieces observed (i.e their model and color) and construct a simplistic build with the observed bricks

The Problem:
It is quite time consuming to think up numerous simplistic builds and find the appropriate LEGO pieces to build it; 
this disengaging task can take away from the experience of playing and creating with legos

Our Solution:
Using this alogorithm, you will easily be able to tell what colour, brick type and how many you need to make that simple build be it a Car or a Hut.

What is the use of this AI?
To aid in the creative building process and save time and effort on a trivial task.
Instead of having to search around what peice would be good or which would be needed and what colour is each piece,
you simply need a camera and this algorithm to tell you what the minimum peices and their colour are needed to build it.
