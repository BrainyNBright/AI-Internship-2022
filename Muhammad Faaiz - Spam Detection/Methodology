ANN TRAINING;-

To train my model i am using a neural network called ANN or 
called Artificial Neural network it, basically it is a simple neural network,
The neuron collects information from input channels named dendrites, processes 
information in its nucleus and then generates an output in a long thin branch called Axon.

some of its activation funcions include:

1. Sigmoid
   -Takes a number between 0 and 1
   -Converts large negative numbers to zero and converts large positive numbers to 1
   -It is generally used as Output Layer. but in our model, we are using softmax as the ouput layer.

2. Softmax

   -The softmax function is sometimes called the softargmax function, or multi-class logistic regression. 
    This is because the softmax is a generalization of logistic regression that can be used for multi-class classification, 
    and its formula is very similar to the sigmoid function which is used for logistic regression. The softmax is very useful 
    because it converts the scores to a normalized probability distribution, which can be displayed to a user or used as input 
    to other systems. For this reason it is usual to append a softmax function as the final layer of the neural network.

Steps:-


1. Loading librairies 
2. Loading Datasets
3. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
   -  this allows us to analyze the datasets main charateristics as in its a form om data selection
4. Data Preparation: to feed the model 
5. Building and training the Deep Learning Model
6. Evaluating the performance of the model
