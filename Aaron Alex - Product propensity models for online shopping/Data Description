The dataset used contains 25 columns of different features.

The first column called "UserID" will be the unique identifier as it will be used
to differentiate from customer to customer.

  Example: a720-6b732349-a720-4862-bd21-644732 

The remaining 24 columns are different features such as:

  basket_icon_click        
  basket_add_list    
  sort_by      
  image_picker             
  account_page_click
  
  and so on..
  
  These features are recorded as either 0 or 1. Meaning if a customer fulfills a
  certain feature, 1 will be assigned to that particular feature.
  
  Example: If a customer adds an item to their basket, the feature "basket_add_detail" will get 
           the number 1 assigned to it.
