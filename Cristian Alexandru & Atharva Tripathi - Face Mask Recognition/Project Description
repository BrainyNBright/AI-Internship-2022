Problem statement: What is the problem?
The problem is that the majority of the people now don’t take virus outbreaks seriously and don’t follow the strict protocols so this is the reason why we are creating this app/machine.


Pitch: Why should people buy or listen to the app/idea?
Tired of people not wearing a mask and increasing the spread of viruses? Well don’t think about it again since we have created the Face Mask Detector! This invention includes a security calling system so the people that don’t wear their masks are taken away for a big fine! But wait! That’s not all, you know those Speedometers on the street? Well now you can even put mask detectors built in! How cool is THAT!


Benefit: How will this benefit the AI community?
This will benefit the AI community alot since people can use it for experimental reasons and also can be used for research. Another reason why is because it is useful and beneficial is because it is compatible, although it takes a few lines of code to set up, if you premake it, your all good to go!



Face mask recognition pros & cons:

Pros:
- Can detect masks from an decently elevated view and can reduce the spreading of viruses and bacteria
- Can help with society behaving according to the rules
- Can help by detecting masks worn by a person in a moving vehicle
- Can signal the nearest person to take action (like a police station) if there is no mask


Cons:
- Overuse of mask might cause havoc (not likely)
- In bad weather the machine might not be able to function properly and might malfunction
