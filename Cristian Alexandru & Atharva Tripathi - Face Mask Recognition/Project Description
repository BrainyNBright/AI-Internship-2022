Problem statement: What is the problem?

The problem is that the majority of the people now don’t take virus outbreaks seriously and don’t 
follow the strict protocols so this is the reason why we are creating this app/machine.


Pitch: Why should people buy or listen to the app/idea?

Tired of people not wearing a mask and increasing the spread of viruses?
Well don’t think about it again since we have created the Face Mask Detector! 


Benefit: How will this benefit the AI community?

This will benefit the AI community a lot since people can use it for experimental 
reasons and can also be used for research. Another reason why it is useful and beneficial 
is because it is compatible with all devices, although it takes a few lines of code to set up, if you premake it, your all good to go!




Tools & Technology Used

1. Python : The code is entirely written with python.
2. Google Colab : It is an online/open-source editor for python and many other programming languages.
3. Keras : Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the Tensorflow library
4. TensorFlow : TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning and machine learning applications.
5. Haar Cascade : Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images regardless of their size. In our case, we train the algorithm to detect masks on people’s faces.
