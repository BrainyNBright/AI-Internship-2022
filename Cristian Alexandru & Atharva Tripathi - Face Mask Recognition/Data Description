#The data set is in this git hub repo


There are two separate folders in the dataset:

  - One for images with mask:
   This contains 1,915 images
 
  - One for images without masks:
   This contains 1,918 images
  
The age of the people in these images vary anywhere from 10 to 70.

Why is age important:

It is important because someone at the age of 50 has a different face structure than someone at age 12. 
This variety ensures that our model will be more accurate.
