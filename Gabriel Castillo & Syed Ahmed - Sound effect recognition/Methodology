As we have stated before, we have created this program to help deaf people feel and hear the world around them despit their disability. 
Now we will show you why we decided to approach this problem. Being deaf is a problem, and we want to help deaf people experience sound. 
So, with the data we have used, we have found a way for deaf people to feel and experience sound. 
With this program, deaf people could use the program to hear and recognize simple words like 'go' or 'up'.
