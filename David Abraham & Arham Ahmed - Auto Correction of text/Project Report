 Autocorrect as the name suggests is a type of software that is capable of correcting an incorrectly spelled word. Ever since we have been able to type text
using keyboards, individuals faced the problem of accidentally inputting a wrong character hence resulting in an incorrect word with sometimes a completely 
different meaning. This is a relatable problem faced by countless people and is always considered as an annoying circumstance. Hence, came the reason why
we chose the autocorrect project in an effort to solve this elusive problem. Needless to say, Autocorrect has several advantages such as increasing 
productivity and improving time management. 




  We now move deeper into the workings and functionings of our project which involves explaining the gathering of data and construction of the code.  
Our code was split into two parts: Section one,”preperations” and Section two, ’Editing’. The first performs all the tasks characterisitc to a code such as 
importing libraries, reading the data file, and creating the required variables. The mentioned data file includes 1001 of the most popular words used by 
individuals. The following section involves creating four specific functions whose roles are to edit the inputted word more speciofically to delete, switch, 
replace, and insert a string. The primary purpose of these functions is to ensure that the output is matched by outcome predicted by the model.



  To conclude, the resulting product was a  successful working Autocorrect model that performed its given function flawlessly. Our model is easily understood 
enabling users to utilize it easily and aiding them in fixing spelling mistakes seamlessly during their typing.
