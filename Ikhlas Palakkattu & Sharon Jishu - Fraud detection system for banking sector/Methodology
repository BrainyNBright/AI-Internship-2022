Libraries to be imported:

- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, os, config, model_dispatcher, joblib, argparse


The data is already seperated into two files called "identity" and "transaction", they are joined by TransactionID. the data is also already split for training and testing

The first step we will take is creating a proper cross validation strategy using "StratifiedKFold " from sklearn

We will then merge the identity and transaction data from the train and test set

Next we wil add a column name called "kfold" to our training data and set the index in accordance with the fold it is

we will build is our model_dispatcher.py of which we call our classifiers and train.py where we train our model

we will import Logistic Regression and Random Forest  and create a dictionary for calling the algorithms into our train script

we set training data as the values in the column "kfold" that and the values that are equal to the fold we passed is the test set. 

Then we do Label encoding to the categorical variables, and fill all missing values with 0 before training our data


Finally we will calculate the accuracy of the  modelusing .accuracy_score from sklearn
