We developed a virtual assistant named Marr and a chat bot support incase of any incident. The software searches across different sources such as google and key words 
based on the specific key phrases and terms that are included in a command.The input will serve as the basis for this search. During this step of the process, it acquires 
information about the user by adopting a number of different modes of data entry, including voice recognition and manual entry. For example, it may recognize the user's 
voice as it enters their information. 
The chatbot uses buttons and pre set sollutions that will allow a user to be able to solve their problem in a matter of minutes. If the issues continue the user will be 
directly connected to a human employee to hopefully help resolve the situation. The chatbot also allows users to report bugs to help improve the performance of the 
virtual assistant.
