What is the Problem? 

Disabled people are not able to travel around the world easily without public transport and if they want to go to some place where it
is not available they have will have to take a lot of trouble to go there and at times they may not be able to go there because it might
take to much of a toll on their health

as most of them wonâ€™t have any problem with their eyes and will be able to drive a car around easily.

How is AI implemented in this problem

AI can be used to tell how the car moves depending on the eye movement and whether or not a driver is focused on the road
